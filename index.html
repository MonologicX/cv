      <h1>Hey.</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>I am a programmer and web developer who made this website and could make you one like it!</p>
      <p>As you can see, I am an amazing web designer... I think.</p>
      <p>The reason I'm not sure is that I taught myself full-stack web development all on my own and I am only 16.</p>
      <p>Contact me if you think that I am have aquired enough skill to make a website for you!</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>But why would I want to let someone so inexperienced handle something as important as my website?</p>
      <p>Because it's cheaper and someone who gets less projects is far more dedicated to making the ones they do get incredible!</p>
      <p>In other words, if you just need a standard personal or comany website I can provide a quality one for much cheaper that usual.</p>
